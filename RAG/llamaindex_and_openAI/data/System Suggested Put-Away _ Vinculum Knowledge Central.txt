## About Putaway

Putaway is the process of efficiently moving items from a received shipment to designated locations within a warehouse. Decisions regarding putaway are based on various factors such as warehouse size, item quantity, weight, storage conditions, and material type. Putaway can be done manually by users during shipment receiving or predefined putaway rules can be established in eRetail. Utilizing putaway rules ensures easy access to goods and organized inventory. for more information please refer to the [System Suggested Put-Away](https://vinculumhelpdesk.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/9000218294-system-suggested-put-away).
