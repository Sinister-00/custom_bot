For example, when order comes for a particular SKU/quantity, the seller may want to prioritize it as “High priority order” OR if the order comes from South India Region, seller may want to fulfill the order from his Chennai warehouse or may be if seller wants to decide on the Transporter partner based on customer pin code.

In such cases, user can define the order validation rule, order routing rule and shipping rule in the system respectively using ’OMS Rules’ module. Once the rules are defined, system would process the orders following the logic placed by the seller.
