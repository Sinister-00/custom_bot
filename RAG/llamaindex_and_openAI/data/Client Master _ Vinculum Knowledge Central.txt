# Client Master

## what is Client Master ?

The Client Master functionality in eRetail allows users to create clients tailored to specific business requirements. It enables users to configure clients separately from the customers of the business. For instance, in Vin eRetail, users engaged in Warehouse Management Services can manage different clients and customers according to their business needs. Customers, typically end-users whose operations are fully managed by the user, are created in the Customer Master. However, for brands and sellers availing only warehousing services to stock inventory for a specific period, these entities are considered clients and can be created in the Client Master. for more details refer this article [Client Master](https://vinculumhelpdesk.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/9000213656-client-master).
