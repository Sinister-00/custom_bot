# Repack - Overview and Process

Repack is a feature used to convert one SKU into one or more SKUs with different quantities or unit measurements (UOM). It's commonly employed to repack bulk items like fresh fruits and vegetables into smaller packets for retail distribution. For instance, a 1kg onion SKU can be repacked into 500g packets. This process involves two SKUs: the "Pack From" SKU (e.g., 1kg onion) and the "Pack To" SKU (e.g., 500g onion). Both SKUs need to be defined in the system beforehand through SKU master. for more details please refer to the [Repack - Overview and Process](https://vinculumhelpdesk.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/9000212586-repack).

## Key Features of Repack:

- **SKU Conversion**: Allows conversion from one SKU to another with different quantities or UOM.
- **Weighted Average Cost Calculation**: Calculates the Weighted Average Cost (WAC) of the new SKU based on the inventory and WAC of the "Pack To" SKU and the total converted quantity of the "Pack From" SKU.
- **Enhanced Inventory Management**: Facilitates efficient management of inventory by repacking items as needed.
