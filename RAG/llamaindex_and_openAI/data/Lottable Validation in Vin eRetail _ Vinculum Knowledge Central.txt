## About Lottable Validation

Efficient warehouse operations start with an organized receiving process. Lottable validation plays a crucial role in this process. It involves grouping or batch creation of SKUs/items based on specific criteria such as pricing, manufacturing date, expiry date, etc., which aids in inventory movement. Lottable validation ensures that these criteria are validated correctly. Common examples of lottable validations include FIFO (First In First Out), LIFO (Last In First Out), and FEFO (First Expiry First Out). for more details you can refer this article [Lottable Validation in Vin eRetail](https://vinculumhelpdesk.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/9000207109-lottable-validation-in-vin-eretail).
