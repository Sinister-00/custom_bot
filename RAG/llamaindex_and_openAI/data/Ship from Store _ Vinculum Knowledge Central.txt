# what is Ship from Store

Ship from Store is a fulfillment operation that enables retailers to fulfill orders using inventory from their store locations, rather than distant distribution centers. This approach allows orders to be fulfilled directly from retail stores, providing customers with faster delivery. for more details please refer to the [Ship from Store](https://vinculumhelpdesk.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/9000203004-ship-from-store).

## Overview:

- **Fulfillment Process**: Orders are fulfilled at retail stores and shipped directly to customers, bypassing central warehouses.
- **Order Management System (OMS)**: Manages the complete order lifecycle, from placement to delivery, efficiently across multiple channels.
- **Order Validation**: Orders received at the store undergo validation rules. If accepted, orders are routed to the optimal warehouse based on various factors like location, inventory, cost, and priority. Rejected orders follow predefined hopping rules to the next fulfillment location.
- **Special Packaging**: Since orders are fulfilled from retail stores, retailers can offer special packaging features like tissue paper, gift wrapping, or personalized greeting cards, enhancing the customer experience.
