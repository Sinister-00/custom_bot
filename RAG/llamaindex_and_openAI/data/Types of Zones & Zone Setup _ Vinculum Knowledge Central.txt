## Types of Zones:

1. **Normal Zones**: Where standard warehouse processes like receiving and staging take place.
2. **Sortation Zones**: Used for sorting SKUs order-wise or customer-wise after picking.

4. **Virtual Zones**: Created for specific actions like checking, sorting, or assembling, such as kitting and let down zones.
