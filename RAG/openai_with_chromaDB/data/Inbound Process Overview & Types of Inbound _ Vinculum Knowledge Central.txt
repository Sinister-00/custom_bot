# Title: Inbound Process Overview

## What is inbound?
The inbound process begins when items arrive at the warehouse location, originating from external sources or other company locations. The responsible user releases the source document (e.g., Purchase Order or inbound transfer order), enabling warehouse workers to proceed with tasks like putting away received items.

## Inbound Process
1. **Recording & Receipts:** Accurate info drives the process (items, quantities, lot numbers, etc.).
2. **Load Arrival:** Pre-loaded info in WMS minimizes errors (docks, staging, unloading).
3. **Receiving:** Barcoded receipts & real-time reporting (one-step or two-step).
4. **LPN Tracking:** Monitors product movement during receiving.
5. **Put-Away & Close:** Operator or system-directed put-away based on WMS configuration.

## 3 Types of Inbound
* Receipt from V endor (ASN, PO, ARS, Backorder , Direct)
* Receipt from another W arehouse or Store (ST O)
* Receipt of Customer Return Order (Return)

## Types of inbound
* **Direct Inbound/Without PO:** Receive products directly from a supplier without a purchase order.
* **with PO:** Receive products based on a previously created purchase order.
* **with ASN:** Receive products that arrive earlier than expected based on an Advance Shipment Notification (ASN).
* **STO Inbound:** Transfer stock from one warehouse to another using a Stock Transfer Order.
* **Return Inbound:** Receive customer returns or undelivered orders back into the warehouse.
