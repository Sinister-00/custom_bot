# Inbound Process Overview & Types of Inbound

## Inbound Process Overview

**What is inbound?**
The inbound process initiates when items arrive at the warehouse location, originating from external sources or other company locations. It involves the receipt of items, releasing source documents like purchase orders (POs) or inbound transfer orders to warehouse workers for further operations, such as put away of received items. for more details refer this article [Inbound Process](https://vinculumhelpdesk.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/9000216454-inbound-process-overview-types-of-inbound).

### Inbound Cycle

#### 1. Recording and Receipts
- **Definition**: Recording and receipts are fundamental to the inbound process, ensuring accuracy and communication at each step.
- **Elements Tracked**: Lot numbers, manufacturing dates, expiration dates, serial numbers, PO tracking, inventory receipt statuses, etc.
- **Benefits**: Automation, real-time receiving, reduction of errors, and cost minimization.

#### 2. Load Arrival
- **Process**: Receiving starts immediately after pre-receipts are loaded into the WMS system.
- **Efficiency**: Pre-receipts allow for advance appointments, dock reservations, and staging area allocation.
- **Minimized Error**: Receipt/load information is entered with minimal human error, facilitating smooth processing.

#### 3. Receiving Real-Time Information
- **Handover**: Receipts are bar-coded with specific instructions for associates to begin receiving activities and real-time reporting.
- **Types of Receiving**:
  - One-Step Receiving: Products sent directly to storage.
  - Two-Step Receiving: Receipt/load needs staging before storage.

#### 4. License Plate Tracking (LPN)
- **Importance**: LPNs are used to track moving products during the receiving process.

#### 5. Put-Away and Receipt Close
- **System Configuration**: WMS system allows for operator-dictated or system-directed put-away methods based on customer settings.

## Types of Inbound

Inbound processes involve receiving, checking, recording, and put away of products into the system upon physical receipt. There are three main types of inbound:

1. **Receipt from Vendor (ASN, PO, ARS, Backorder, Direct)**
2. **Receipt from Another Warehouse or Store (STO)**
3. **Receipt of Customer Return Order (Return)**

### Detailed Types:

1. **Direct Inbound/ Without PO**
   - **Definition**: Inbound without a PO, directly inward of received products.
   - **Requirement**: Vendor code is necessary for inbound processing.

2. **With PO**
   - **Process**: Inbound is done when a PO is raised.
   - **Requirement**: PO number is essential for inbound processing.

3. **With ASN (Advance Shipping Note)**
   - **Scenario**: Goods arrive earlier than expected.
   - **Requirement**: ASN number replaces the PO number for inbound processing.

4. **STO Inbound (Stock Transfer Order)**
   - **Process**: Transfer stock from one warehouse to another.
   - **Usage**: User with multiple locations or warehouses.

5. **Return Inbound**
   - **Scenario**: Customer returns or delivery failure.
   - **Purpose**: Reallocate bins and zones for returned orders.
