## what is Put-Away

Put-Away is the process of moving items from a received shipment to the appropriate locations in a warehouse. The decisions regarding Put-Away are based on factors such as warehouse size, quantity of items received, physical weight, storage conditions, or the type of material present in the warehouse. It can be done manually by the user at the time of receiving shipment or through pre-defined Put-Away rules in eRetail. Using Put-Away rules facilitates easy access to goods and ensures organized inventory. for more details please refer to the [Put-Away Enquiry](https://vinculumhelpdesk.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/9000218292-put-away-enquiry).
