# SKU Master
## Introduction  
This text provides a concise explanation of what a Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) is and its significance in inventory management:
A Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) is a unique identifier assigned to a specific type of item, allowing it to be purchased, sold, or tracked. This identifier typically consists of an alphanumeric code or scannable barcode printed on the item or its packaging. The SKU encapsulates various attributes associated with the item, such as manufacturer name, material, color, size, warranty, etc., which differentiate it from other item types. 
The term "SKU" is widely used across different sectors including stores, e-commerce platforms, warehouses, product fulfillment centers, and any other businesses involved in inventory management. 
In a system, the SKU Master serves as a comprehensive collection of all SKUs and their corresponding details. Users can easily search and retrieve information about any SKU stored in the system using the SKU Master data, facilitating efficient inventory management and tracking processes.
