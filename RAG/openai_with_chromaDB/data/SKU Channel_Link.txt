# <u> SKU Channel Mapping</u>
**1. Why do we need to do SKU Channel Mapping**  
SKU Channel mapping enables users to establish connections between their marketplace listings and the SKU listings within Vin-eRetail. This mapping is essential for ensuring the smooth flow of orders and inventory management processes. Users can associate Vin-eRetail SKUs with marketplace SKUs, referred to as "Channel SKUs," as well as with marketplace-specific identifiers such as Product Id, Serial No., or Variant Id, known as "Channel Product Id."

**2. How can We do the listing/Mapping of SKU's pulled from the marketplace**  
If the SKUs created on channel and SKUs created on Vin-eRetail both are different, then it
will be visible to the user under Un-mapped SKUs screen.  
Navigate: Sales << SKU Channel Link << Unmapped SKU

**6. How can we change/update the listing in Bulk for any specific marketplace**  
Users have the ability to efficiently manage SKU-channel links by adding or updating records in bulk through the SKU/channel link import screen. This is facilitated by importing an Excel template specifically designed for SKU-channel linking. The template includes all the necessary fields outlined in the "Add New", providing users with a comprehensive framework for inputting data. Additionally, the Excel template offers users flexibility in performing various functions with SKUs, such as creating, updating, or removing records. Users can download the CSV template, input data directly or copy/paste from other sources, and then save the file on their computer. Finally, users can upload the saved file by selecting it through the "Choose File" tab, enabling seamless updating of SKU-channel links based on their needs.
