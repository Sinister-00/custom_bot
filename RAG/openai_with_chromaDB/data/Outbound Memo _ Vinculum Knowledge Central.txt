## what is Outbound Memo?
The Outbound Memo is a crucial tool for sending items out of the warehouse for various purposes, such as PR, photoshoots, free samples, client gifting, or repairs, which are not associated with sales orders, returns, or stock transfers. Managing Outbound Memo involves two main screens: Outbound Memo Enquiry Screen and Outbound Memo Create/Edit.
