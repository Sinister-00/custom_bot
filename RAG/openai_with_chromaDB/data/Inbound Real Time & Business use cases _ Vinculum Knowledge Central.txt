Navigation : **WMS>Inbound>Inbound RealTime**

## Business Use Cases:
The eRetail system offers various features for inbound logistics:

* **IMEI tracking:** For electronics, enable "Serial tracking" to capture unique IMEI numbers during inbound.
* **Batch/Expiry/Multi-MRP:** Manage shelf life by creating "Lottable validation" (e.g., expiry date) and selecting it for the SKU. The system captures this data and generates lot numbers during inbound.
* **PO vs Vendor Invoice:** Update purchase order pricing based on formulas to handle price changes. Capture vendor invoice details in "Manage Vendor Invoice" for financial settlement.
* **System Suggested Put-away:** Create putaway rules to assign specific bins to SKUs. Use "System Suggested Put-away" during inbound for automatic bin suggestions based on these rules.
* **SKU Barcode:** Generate barcodes during inbound for inventory tracking. The system can design barcode formats and print them based on user needs.
* **Item Level Barcode/USN:** Enable "Unique Serial No (USN)" for SKUs to track each item. The system generates unique serial numbers during inbound.
* **Multiple Inbound per Purchase Order:** Allow multiple inbound receipts for a single purchase order (status remains "Partially received").
* **Warehouse App:** Facilitate real-time receiving and putaway using the warehouse app.
* **LPN/Unit Tracking:** Track inbound using either LPN (License Plate Number) or SKU.
* **Currency Conversion:** Manage currency conversion for vendors with different currencies by setting conversion rates in "Other Masters."
